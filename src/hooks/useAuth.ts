// This file is effectively a re-export if useAuth is defined and exported in AuthContext.tsx
// For this scaffold, we'll assume useAuth is directly exported from AuthContext.tsx.
// If a separate file is strictly needed:
/*
"use client";
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { AuthContext, AuthContextType } // AuthContextType might need to be imported from types
from '@/contexts/AuthContext'; // Assuming AuthContext is default export or named export

export const useAuth = (): AuthContextType => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};
*/
// Keeping this file empty as useAuth is exported from AuthContext.tsx
// Delete if not necessary (guideline: small files with correct abstractions) - decided to keep useAuth export within AuthContext.tsx
// This file can be removed. For the sake_of_progress, I will mark it as empty to delete it.
